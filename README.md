# Guidance-System-for-blind [Project time: June 2018 to July 2020]
<br> This project includes deep learning with computer vision and image processing.
Raspberry pi4 is the heart of the project.
This project has 3 modes:
1) Descriptive mode
2) Navigation mode
3) OCR mode (reading mode)</br>
Mode 1:
Here a pretrained model is used to detect, recognize and inform the blind person(user) what object is in front of the user.
The output is in the form of audio to the blind person through the earphones.</br>
Mode 2:
Here we custom trained a model for door detection so that the user knows as he encounters doors of the house while in mode 2. In addition for navigation we used ultrasonic sensors and a vibration motor for navigation.</br>
Mode 3:
Here we built a code where we are using a text extraction module to extract text from the image and then converting the text to audio.The audio is then available on earphones for the user.</br>
Created a Youtube video showcasing the project: https://youtu.be/G2sGJ4e67c0?t=98</br>
